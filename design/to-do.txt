Milestone Goals:

Fully implement your app, using the base static site you created in Milestone 2
All CRUD actions must be supported
Data must be persisted to localStorage or IndexedDB
You must also have a way to import/export or share data (see detailed instructions)
Your app should interact with at least one external API
You must demonstrate your knowledge of asynchronous JavaScript
Such as multiple chained API calls or other asynchronous code
Or multiple calls that execute concurrently
Don't forget to use a browser-ready, client-side JavaScript library
See Awesome JavaScriptLinks to an external site. (anything from the "Files" section onwards)
You're looking for "browser-ready" libraries; avoid anything that uses "npm" or "node", etc.

Bugs to Fix:

make the recipes filter out based on tag
fix the AI generation
Fix the API code
Check to see if it passes WAVE
Push to generation
